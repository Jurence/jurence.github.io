            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                As a Senior QA Engineer with 5+ years of industry experience, I bring a deep understanding and
                proficiency in the multifaceted realm of software quality assurance. My journey through the
                software development lifecycle has equipped me with a robust skill set that spans from intricate
                software design to the nuanced art of software testing and maintenance.
                My technical acumen has been honed through the creation of high-performance web applications, where
                I’ve meticulously helped with design and scaled systems that stand resilient against faults.
                My portfolio is a tapestry of projects, both minute and monumental, with each thread representing my
                unwavering commitment to producing code that’s not only high in quality but also maintainable and scalable.
                Throughout my tenure, I’ve thrived in collaborative environments, working shoulder to shoulder with
                product managers, designers, and developers to forge software solutions that don’t just fulfill business
                needs but surpass user aspirations. My role has often extended beyond coding; I’ve mentored budding
                QA developers, refined code reviews to an art, and been a driving force behind the establishment of
                coding standards and best practices within the QA spec in the organisations. At the helm of this
                technical odyssey, I navigated our team through the challenges of startup growth, securing substantial
                pre-seed funding, and launching a platform that swiftly garnered traction and a burgeoning user base.
                This endeavor not only tested but also affirmed my leadership capabilities and my ability to turn vision
                into reality.

                My passion for technology is matched only by my zeal for continuous learning. Staying abreast of the
                latest industry trends and technologies is more than a practice; it’s a passion that fuels my desire
                to embrace new tools, master fresh skills, and conquer emerging challenges.
                In essence, I am not just a Senior QA Engineer; I am a catalyst for quality, an orchestrator of
                reliability, and a seasoned veteran poised to deliver exceptional software solutions.
                With a track record of success and a toolbox of expertise, I stand ready to be an invaluable contributor
                to any development team seeking excellence.
